# AskiArt
This project is a straightforward Python script that converts images into ASCII art. By converts it to grayscale, and resizes it according to user-defined dimensions. It then maps different shades of gray to ASCII characters, creating a text-based representation of the original image. The resulting ASCII art is printed directly to the console.
